    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      When I was young, I like the computer. There was a time that the first
      computer of my father was broken. I opened it, tried to repair and finally
      accomplished it which make me feel elated. After that, I decided to learn,
      research, and get a job related to computers in the future. After
      graduating, here are my objectives:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Short-term objective: Full-stack developer.</li>
      <li>Long-term objective: Senior Full-stack developer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then, I went to work at Headway Company for 2 years. Here are my
      experiences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 years as Mobile Developer.</li>
      <li>1 year in Full Stack Developer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With nearly 2 years of experience in Headway projects and projects linked
      between RMIT University and companies (Wizeline and Dreamplex), I believe
      I will bring great value to the company and customers. So, the crucial
      goals will be achieved.
